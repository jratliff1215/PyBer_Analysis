# PyBer Analysis

# Overview
The analysis of the PyBer Data was performed to understand the differences in the ride data by city type and to provide strategy recommendations to the client using the findings. Our firm utilize MatPlotLib and Pandas to analyze the provided data. 

## Original Analysis
The original data analysis the client requested involved a large scope of work. This analysis provided information that is relevant to initial work. However, the final analysis provided to the client narrowed the scope to weekly fares by city type. 

# Results

## Urban Drivers
Urban cities have the highest number of rides and drivers. This is likely directly correlated with the population of the area served. The data analyzed included 1,625 urban rides, more than 2.1 times the suburban and rural areas combined. The higher rides analyzed is likely a contributor to the low average fare per ride. To ensure the connection, an analysis of trip length is needed. The analysis of trip length may provide better insight to true per mile revenue for Pyber.

## Higher Price in Rural Areas
The high fare of rural costs per ride may be associated with the low number of drivers. With each driver in rural areas completing an average of 1.6 rides compared to an average of 0.7 rides for the urban areas, the limited supply of drivers in rural areas may lead to higher prices. The chart below represents the skewed percentage of availabe dirvers in each area. As shown, urban areas account for more than 68% of total drivers. While most of the demand is in urban areas, the lack of rural drivers may be a cause of the high fare prices.

## Peak Times
The graph below represents ride data from January 2019 through April 2019. Each area shows an upward trend in late February for ride fare. In a review of the raw data, demand was in line with other months. Therefore, this uptick in fares should be analyzed further to determine the cause.

# Recommendations
1.	We recommend a revision of pricing based on demand times. This includes a review of holidays and special events to capitalize on higher demand to incur higher fares. During lower demand times, fares should be based on a standard mile amount. 
2.	Average pricing in rural areas in likely based on additional trip mileage and lower driver supply. We recommend standardizing costs between areas to encourage riders or increasing drivers available to lower price gouging. 
3.	Suburban incentives could be provided to increase riders in these areas. By encouraging car pools to urban centers or standardizing fares to urban centers, demand for these areas would likely increase.
